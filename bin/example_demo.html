<p>When viewing the stereo examples, cross your eyes slightly so that
the images appear to merge, and you should see depth to
the animation.  If you are having trouble, one way to get your eyes to cross slightly is to
focus on a finger held in front of the animation, roughly halfway from
your eyes to the screen.</p>
